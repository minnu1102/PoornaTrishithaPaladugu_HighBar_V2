  "output": {
    "hypothesis": "ROAS dropped last week primarily due to a significant decline in Click-Through Rate (CTR), indicating that the ad creative has become stale or less engaging to the target audience.",
    "reasoning": "Spend remained constant at $1000.0, and Impressions also remained flat at 50,000. However, Clicks plummeted by 48.91%, from a baseline of 920 to 470. This directly resulted in a 48.91% drop in CTR, from 1.84% (920/50000) to 0.94% (470/50000). Since the conversion rate per click (Revenue/Clicks) remained stable (150 in both periods), the drastic reduction in clicks directly led to a 48.91% decrease in Revenue (from $138,000 to $70,500). Consequently, ROAS dropped by 48.91%, from 138.0 to 70.5. The stable impressions combined with a sharp drop in CTR strongly suggest that the ad creative is no longer effectively capturing audience attention, leading to reduced engagement."
